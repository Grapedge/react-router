# Testing React Router Apps

There are a few different ways to test an application built with React Router.
We have guides for the following tools:

- [Cypress](testing-with-cypress.md)
- Jest with:
  - [ReactDOM `test-utils`](testing-with-jest-react-dom-test-utils.md)
  - [React Test Renderer](testing-with-jest-react-test-renderer.md)
  - [React Testing Library](testing-with-jest-react-testing-library.md)
- [Mocha](testing-with-mocha.md)

Whatever you end up using, try to avoid testing React Router itself. That's our
responsibility, and it's one we take seriously!
